The Company has applied the new revenue standard to all contracts that were entered into after adoption and to all contracts that were open as of the initial date of adoption. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new standard impacts the Company's net sales on an ongoing basis depending on the relative amount of revenue sold through its distributors, the change in inventory held by its distributors, and the changes in price concessions granted to its distributors. Previously, the Company deferred revenue and cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributor sold the product to their end customer. As required by the new revenue standard, the Company no longer defers revenue and cost of sales, but rather, estimates the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and records revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. Sales to non-distributor customers, under both the previous and new revenue standards, are generally recognized upon the Company\u2019s shipment of the product.

In light of this uncertainty, on December 22, 2017 the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) No. 118, \u201cIncome Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d to address uncertainty in the application of U.S. GAAP when the registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act.

The $186.0 million was primarily composed of expense of $161.0 million related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, $33.6 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and a benefit of $10.3 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions. In accordance with the requirements of SAB 118, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Teradyne completed its analysis of the effect of the Tax Reform Act based on the application of the most recently available guidance as of December 31, 2018 and recorded $49.5 million of net income tax benefit.
